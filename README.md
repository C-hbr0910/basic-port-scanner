# Basic Port Scanning Script

This is a basic Python port scanner script to help identify open ports on a target. Itâ€™s a simple way to get started with networking and cybersecurity scripting.

## How It Works
- Uses Python's `socket` library to attempt connections to specified ports.
- Reports any open ports it finds.

## Usage
Run the script with Python 3:

```bash
python3 port_scanner.py
